Create a React app that uses Material UI library.
Create a color generator, that generates a palette of 8 different random colors (in hex
code) every time the user clicks on [Generate Color Palette] Button.
You should display the color and its hex value and a like button [♡ icon button].
The user can “like” colors, after which the liked colors will persist on the palette when the
user clicks on [Generate Color Palette] button.
The user should also be able to “unlike” liked colors.
Under each color there should be a button that says [Set As Primary Color], which
should set the color of the MUI Theme palette “primary” color. Once the user chooses the
primary color, you need to detect whether the primary color the user chose is light or dark,
if the selected primary color is light you need to set the theme mode as “light” and if the
selected primary color is dark you need to set the theme mode as “dark”.
You need to store the last 5 choices of primary colors and allow the user to pick from the
previously selected colors. These colors can be removed from the stored history.

Please note that the theme mode should control the background color of the app (light/
dark).
The color of [Set As Primary Color] button and [Generate Color Palette] button should
be the primary color.

Bonus points for the following:

-   Clean Git
-   Readability
-   TypeScript

Please keep in mind there is no right or wrong way of doing anything, and the goal of the
assessment is to attest your fitness with the team and what possible responsibilities you
could be handling.
There are no points for the design, please do not waste your time on it, however, if you do
write any CSS, please do it nicely.

Please share your work in the form of a Git repository.

Feel free to ask us any questions; good luck!
